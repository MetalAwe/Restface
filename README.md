RestFace -- sweet and simple restaurant interface
# Description
A sweet and simple restaurant interface, Restface is the solution that every restaurant needs. 
The current demo features all the essential subroutines a restaurant interface system should have, such as a login system, 6 tables, the possibility of reading and writing food and drinks from and to files and lastly but most importantly, a partially developed system for printing a bill.
A VB.NET app, RestFace is full of features. I have implemented a log in screen, reading, writing and deleting food and drinks to and from files, and even a receipt print screen.
# Installation
For now, the user needs to download the .zip file using the code button and run the .sln file in a code editor of their choice.
# TODO
I have the following features in mind:
* Finishing the receipt system.
* Adding a window for inventory management
* A reservation system
* An option for adding or removing tables.
